> A simple module using cluster to force your process running permanently.

## Important notes before you use the module

0. **The main file, that is, your application, you need to _configure in the different file_, like keepalive.js, for example, and _run with node the keepalive file_.**
1. **Connection** and **process** are _very_ different things. Be that in mind.
2. If your machine(including servers) is down, it is clear that this module will not work.
3. If you shutdown the process using `ctrl + c` or `pm2 stop`, `pm2 restart`, the actions that trigger the "SIGINT" signal, the module will not resurrect the workers. 
4. If you send a `shutdown` message to the master process using `process.send({ message: "shutdown" })`, the cluster will shutdown all worker processes, and if you define the worker to shutdown by sending `process.send({ message: "shutdown", worker: 0 })`, it will only shutdown in that worker.
5. If you send `process.send({ message: "shutdown-all" })`, the cluster will shutdown all workers processes.
6. The KeepAlive module will alert a error message and close the process if you try to run the KeepAlive Cluster in worker process.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

```sh
$ npm i process-keep-alive --save
```

```sh
$ yarn add process-keep-alive
```

## Usage

- main.js

```js
const { Cluster } = require("process-keep-alive")
const cluster = new Cluster({
    /**
     * @param {string} mainFile - Defines which file the cluster will run. 
     */
    file: `${process.cwd()}/test.js`, 
    /**
     * @param {object} env - Defines the environment variables that will be used by workers. Default: process.env
     */
    env: process.env,
    workerCount: 1
})

cluster.init()
```


- test.js

```js
setTimeout(() => undefinedMethod(), 10000)
```
